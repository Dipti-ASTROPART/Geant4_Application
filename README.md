## ü§π‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **Controlling the program flow**
### **1. Visualization**
The visualization is controlled by the **vis.mac** macro file located inside the macrofiles directory. The basis set up consists of:
<pre>
   /run/initialize                                  # Initialize the visual executive
   /vis/open OGL                                    # Visualization driver
   /vis/viewer/set/viewpointVector 2.0 0.0 0.0      # The view pointer 
   /vis/viewer/set/lightsVector -1 0 0
   /vis/drawVolume                                  # Draw the volume
   /vis/viewer/set/autoRefresh true                 # auto refresh
   /vis/scene/add/trajectories smooth               # trajectory type
   #/vis/scene/add/scale 1 m                        # If you want to see the scale
   #/vis/scene/add/axes                             # Draw (X, Y, Z) axes
   /vis/scene/add/eventID                           # Add event ID
   #/vis/reviewKeptEvents                           # review the evevnt
   /vis/scene/endOfEventAction accumulate           # Accumulate in case of mulitple beam at once
   /vis/viewer/flush
</pre>

### **2. Run in batch mode**
The application can be run in batch mode while the run is controlled by the **G4SIM.cnt** file. The basic control flow of the **.cnt** file includes:
<pre>
 Task                    G4SIM                                           # Task name
 InputPath               /path/to/inputfile/dir/                         # Input path
 OutputPath              /path/to/outputfile/dir/                        # Output Path
 PrimaryEnergy           0.100   0.100                                   # Energy range (MeV) of primary beam
 PrimaryParticle         photon                                          # Primary particle name used as beam
 MacroPath               /macro/files/path                               # Path containing `.mac' files
 NBeam                   50000                                           # Number of beams in one run
 GraphicalMode           0                                               # [ `1' for True | `0' for False]
</pre>

**Note 1:** The `PrimaryEnergy` gives the option to choose the energy range which generates random energy based on a power law distribution. If the values are kept the same, it essentially generates particle beam of constant energy. The basis unit of input energy is given in MeV. 

**Note 2:** The primary particle definitions are added in the `g4PrimaryGenerator.cc` class. The available primary particles are: 

**`electron/e-`, `positron/e+`, `muon+/mu+`, `muon-/mu-`, `photon/gamma`, `proton`, `alpha`, `Li6`, `Li7`, `Be9`, `B10`, `B11`, `C12`, `C13`, `N14`, `N15`, `O16`, `O17`, `O18`, `F19`, `Ne20`, `Ne21`, `Ne22`, `Na23`, `Mg24`, `Mg25`, `Mg26`, `Al27`, `Si28`, `Si29`, `Si30`.**
